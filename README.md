# ADIP-dithering

This is an assignment from the **Advanced Digital Image Processing (ADIP)** course, focusing on the development and implementation of **Floyd‚ÄìSteinberg dithering**.  
The objective is to strengthen understanding of image quantization and enhance C programming skills through practical image processing tasks.

False contours often appear due to quantization. A common solution is **Floyd‚ÄìSteinberg dithering**, which distributes the quantization error of a pixel to its neighboring pixels to create a visually smoother result.
