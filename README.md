# ADIP-dithering
It's an ADIP course assignment about the development of Floyd-Steinberg dithering. The goal is to enhance the understanding of image processing and C programming ability.

False contours appear in the image because of quantization, and one of the solutions is Floyd-Steinberg dithering, which adds quantization error of a pixel onto its neighboring pixels.
